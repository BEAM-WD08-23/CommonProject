## Markup language

Markup languages are used to annotate text with structural and presentational information. 
They define how elements in a document should be structured, formatted, and displayed. Markup languages are commonly used for creating documents that need to be displayed in different formats, such as web pages, eBooks, and documents for printing. EX: html (Hyphertext Markup Language)

## Markdown language

Markdown languages, on the other hand, are lightweight markup languages designed for easy and quick formatting of elements. They are commonly used in situations where simple formatting is needed, like writing documents, notes, or content for the web. Ex: README file  

##  markdown language advantages

## markdown language limits

* it doesn't have syntax highlights, page or line break ...
* no autogenerated table of contents & it lacks standard of rendering. ex: it looks different in differnt medias ...
